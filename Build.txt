The Siliko project uses CMake <http://www.cmake.org> to automate its build setup.
CMake allows for creating build systems based on makefiles and various IDEs. The
Siliko Project's build system is tested and designed to work with the following
operating systems and generators:

* Linux: Unix Makefiles
* FreeBSD: Unix Makefiles
* OS X: Unix Makefiles
* Microsoft Windows: NMake Makefiles

Siliko is also tested with the following compilers:

* Linux: GCC and Clang
* FreeBSD: Clang
* OS X: Clang
* Windows: Visual C++ (cl.exe)

To build the Siliko project, using the default values, create a directory called Build,
then cd into the directory:

mkdir Build
cd Build

Once in the Build directory, you will need to run the cmake command. On Mac OS X,
FreeBSD, and Linux, the default generator is the Unix Makefiles generator. It
suffices to run cmake with the location of the Siliko Project's source files:

cmake ..

On Windows, you will need to specify -G "NMake Makefiles" to use NMake for the build
process. You will also need to build in the a Visual Studio command-prompt, which
sets up an evironment suitable for building software, rather than the default
command-prompt.

cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..

There are additional options that you can specify
* BUILD_TESTS: Whether or not to build test programs. Default On.
* BUILD_GUI:   Whether or not to build GUI frontends. Default On.

Use the -D paramter to CMake to specify these options. For example to disable
building tests:

cmake  .. -DBUILD_TESTS=Off

Building an Installation Package

CMake allows for building installation packages for various systems. At present,
the Siliko project is configured to build an installer on Windows using the Nullsoft
Scriptable Install System, and a Drag-and-Drop disk image on OS X. For other
systems, It's assumed that an imediate installation suffices, and that package
maintainers for each system will build installation packages using their own
processes. To build an installation package on Windows and OS X, build the target
"package" with make or nmake.

If you are using external tools to build a package file, such as an RPM or DEB
package, you can use the DESTDIR variable to make to specify a staging location
to install the packages:

make DESTDIR=~/build/stage install
